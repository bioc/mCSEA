\usage{
mCSEATest(rank, methData, pheno = NULL, column = 1,
  regionsTypes = c("promoters", "genes", "CGI"), customAnnotation = NULL,
  minCpGs = 5, nproc = 1, nperm = NULL, platform = "450k")
}
\arguments{
\item{rank}{A named numeric vector with the ranking statistic of each CpG
site}

\item{methData}{A data frame or a matrix containing Illumina's CpG probes in
rows and samples in columns. A SummarizedExperiment object can be used too}

\item{pheno}{A data frame or a matrix containing samples in rows and
covariates in columns. If NULL (default), pheno is extracted from the
SummarizedExperiment object}

\item{column}{The column name or number from pheno used to split the samples
into groups (first column is used by default)}

\item{regionsTypes}{A character or character vector indicating the predefined
regions to be analyzed. NULL to skip this step and use customAnnotation.}

\item{customAnnotation}{An optional list with the CpGs associated to each
feature (default = NULL)}

\item{minCpGs}{Minimum number of CpGs associated to a region. Regions below
this threshold are not tested}

\item{nproc}{Number of processors to use in GSEA step (default = 1)}

\item{nperm}{(deprecated) Number of permutations to do in GSEA step in the 
previous implementation. Now, this parameter is ignored}

\item{platform}{Platform used to get the methylation data (450k or EPIC)}
}
\value{
A list with the results of each of the analyzed regions. For each
region type, a data frame with the results and a list with the probes
associated to each region are generated. In addition, this list also contains
the input methData, pheno and platform objects
}
\description{
Perform a methylated CpG sites enrichment analysis in predefined genomic
regions
